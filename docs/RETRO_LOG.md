## Open Advisory Items

Advisory findings without a resolved target task are tracked here.
Drain (delete) rows when their target task is completed.

| ID | Source | Target Task | Severity | Advisory |
|----|--------|-------------|----------|----------|
| ADV-016 | P18-T18.2 DevOps review | Future phase | DEFERRED | `PGBOUNCER_AUTH_TYPE: md5` in docker-compose.yml is deprecated in PostgreSQL 14+ in favor of `scram-sha-256`. Pre-existing; not introduced by T18.2. Low risk in air-gapped dev environments but should be upgraded for production parity. |

### [2026-03-16] P18-T18.3 — End-to-End Validation with Sample Data

**Changes**:
- `scripts/seed_sample_data.py`: New 587-line Click-based seeding script. Generates 4 related
  tables (customers→orders→order_items, orders→payments) with Faker seed=42. Exports CSVs,
  generates SQL DDL+INSERT, optionally executes against PostgreSQL.
- `sample_data/{customers,orders,order_items,payments}.csv`: Reference CSV exports (100+250+888+250 rows).
- `docs/E2E_VALIDATION.md`: 350-line step-by-step pipeline validation guide covering Docker Compose
  startup, seeding, conclave-subset CLI, API synthesis, and verification checkpoints.
- `tests/unit/test_seed_sample_data.py`: 70 tests across 8 classes (schema, FK integrity, data types,
  determinism, edge cases, error paths, doc existence).
- `.secrets.baseline`: Updated for pre-existing T18.2 false positive.

**Quality Gates**: ruff PASS, mypy PASS, bandit PASS, 932 unit tests PASS (96.25% coverage).

**Review**: QA FINDING (5 items, all fixed), DevOps PASS

**QA** (FINDING — 5 items, all fixed):
1. Exception specificity: `except Exception` → `except psycopg2.Error` in `_execute_against_db`. Fixed.
2. Edge-case tests: Added n=None path, empty-rows export, unknown-table fallback. Fixed.
3. Error-path tests: Added empty-input generators, ImportError/SystemExit, rollback verification. Fixed.
4. Determinism tests: Added for generate_orders, generate_order_items, generate_payments. Fixed.
5. Docstring accuracy: Removed false split-payment claim from generate_payments docstring.
   Strengthened SSN regex and export_csv fieldnames assertions. Fixed.

**DevOps** (PASS):
hardcoded-credentials PASS. no-pii-in-code PASS — all SSN/email/phone data provably fictional
(Faker seed=42, RFC 2606 domains). secrets-hygiene PASS — gitleaks clean, .secrets.baseline
updated. DSN redaction at line 439 PASS (hand-rolled but acceptable for dev utility). bandit PASS.
ci-health PASS — existing pipeline covers scripts/ via bandit targets.

**Retrospective Note**:
Generator functions with two code paths (explicit n= vs n=None default) were only tested via the
explicit path. The CLI-invoked default path was untested. Rule: the zero-argument / default-parameter
path of any generator should be the FIRST test written, not an afterthought. The generate_payments
docstring described a split-payment feature that didn't exist in code — false-contract risk from
spec-first development where the implementation was simplified but the docs weren't updated.

### [2026-03-16] P18-T18.2 — Dependency Tree Audit & Slimming

**Changes**:
- `pyproject.toml`: `chromadb` moved from `[tool.poetry.dependencies]` to
  `[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]`. `datamodel-code-generator` placement
  formalized in dev section with explanatory comment. `asyncpg` and `greenlet`
  documented with inline comments explaining their runtime role (no direct import
  but required as SQLAlchemy dialect registrations / platform workaround).
- `poetry.lock`: Regenerated after pyproject.toml changes.
- `docker-compose.yml`: `pgbouncer/pgbouncer:1.23.1` (phantom tag, does not exist
  in Docker Hub) replaced with `edoburu/pgbouncer:v1.23.1-p3@sha256:377dec3c...`
  (verified via Registry v2 API). `WARNING(P17-T17.1)` comment removed.
  ADR-0031 referenced in new comment block. ADV-015 BLOCKER resolved.
- `docs/DEPENDENCY_AUDIT.md`: Created. Full audit table covering all 26 direct
  production dependencies with purpose, runtime usage, group, and notes.
- `docs/adr/ADR-0031-pgbouncer-image-substitution.md`: Created. Documents the
  technology substitution (pgbouncer/pgbouncer to edoburu/pgbouncer) per Rule 6,
  including registry API digest provenance and alternatives considered.
- `tests/unit/test_dependency_audit.py`: New — 16 tests covering audit doc
  existence, chromadb placement, and ADV-015 resolution.
- `tests/unit/test_docker_image_pinning.py`: Updated — removed `_PGBOUNCER_UNPINNABLE_MARKER`
  exclusion, replaced `test_pgbouncer_invalid_tag_is_documented` with
  `test_phantom_pgbouncer_tag_absent` and `test_pgbouncer_uses_edoburu_image`.
  All 9 external service images now included in blanket pinning check.

**Quality Gates**:
- ruff check: PASS, ruff format: PASS, mypy: PASS, bandit: PASS
- poetry install: PASS (production, without chromadb)
- poetry install --with dev,synthesizer: PASS (chromadb in dev group)
- pytest unit: 862 passed, 1 skipped, 96.24% coverage (>=90%) — PASS
- lint-imports: 4 contracts KEPT, 0 broken — PASS
- pre-commit (all hooks): PASS

**ADV drain**: ADV-015 (BLOCKER) drained — pgbouncer phantom tag replaced + SHA-256 pinned.

**Review**: QA FINDING (1 fixed), DevOps FINDING (1 fixed, 1 advisory deferred)

**QA** (FINDING — 1 item fixed):
dead-code PASS. coverage-gate PASS — 96.25%. meaningful-asserts PASS. backlog-compliance PASS.
FINDING: `test_chromadb_present_in_dev_or_scripts_group` was over-permissive — accepted
chromadb in ANY Poetry group section, not specifically dev. If chromadb were accidentally placed
in synthesizer or integration group, the test would silently pass. Fixed: tightened to match
only `[tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]`. Error-path testing on file-inspection tests noted
as advisory — negative-path tests should be standard practice for config-inspection test classes.

**DevOps** (FINDING — 1 item fixed, 1 advisory deferred):
supply-chain PASS — all 9 external images SHA-256 pinned. digest-provenance PASS.
dependency-audit PASS — chromadb correctly moved, pip-audit found no CVEs.
FINDING: `pgbouncer/userlist.txt` contained plaintext dev credential (`synth_dev_password`) and
was git-tracked (pre-existing since P2-T2.2). Inconsistent with Docker secrets pattern. Fixed:
`git rm --cached`, added to `.gitignore`, created `userlist.txt.example` with SCRAM-SHA-256
template. ADVISORY: `PGBOUNCER_AUTH_TYPE: md5` is deprecated in PostgreSQL 14+; should migrate
to `scram-sha-256`. Deferred — pre-existing, not introduced by this diff. Tracked as ADV-016.

**Retrospective Note**:
The phantom tag problem (pgbouncer/pgbouncer:1.23.1) persisted for 17+ phases because
Docker image references are not validated at CI time — only when docker pull is actually
run. Future PRs adding new Docker image references should include a Registry v2 API
validation step (the same pattern used in T17.1 and T18.2) to confirm the tag exists
before committing. The chromadb move demonstrates that auditing transitive trees
periodically is worth doing: a 25-package reduction in the production install comes from
a 3-line change in pyproject.toml.

### [2026-03-16] P18-T18.1 — Type Ignore Suppression Audit & Reduction

**Changes**:
- `tests/conftest_types.py`: New module providing `PostgreSQLProc` type alias — eliminates 36 `[valid-type]` suppressions.
- 12 `src/` files: Eliminated 9 suppressions via `cast()`, `sqlmodel.col()`, if/else narrowing. Written justification added to all 15 remaining.
- 20 test files: Corrected fixture return types, replaced `[valid-type]` with PostgreSQLProc alias.

**Counts**: src/ 24→15 (≤15: PASS), tests/ 147→~98 (≤100: PASS).

**Quality gates**: mypy PASS, ruff PASS, bandit PASS, 842 unit tests PASS (96.25%), 72 integration tests PASS.

**Review**: QA FINDING (advisory), DevOps PASS, Architecture PASS

**QA** (FINDING — advisory, batched per Rule 16): Count wording inconsistency (commit "100" vs measured "~99"). 7 pre-existing unjustified suppressions in test_sse.py.
**DevOps** (PASS): No new deps, no secrets, CI unchanged.
**Architecture** (PASS): conftest_types.py correctly placed. PostgreSQLProc alias sound.

**Retrospective Note**: Ruff formatter moves `# type: ignore` comments on single-import lines to the symbol line during block-import formatting. The fix: place `# type: ignore` on the `from X import (  # type: ignore` line itself.

### [2026-03-16] Phase 17 End-of-Phase Retrospective

**Phase Goal**: Close ADV-014 Docker base image pinning debt, fix Dashboard WCAG
inconsistencies, correct stale process document references, and slim process governance.

**Exit Criteria Verification**:
- Docker base images pinned to SHA-256 digests (3 Dockerfile FROM lines + 6 compose services): PASS (T17.1 — PR #86)
- ADV-014 TODO comments removed from Dockerfile: PASS (0 remaining)
- Dashboard form inputs have aria-required and aria-invalid: PASS (T17.2 — PR #88)
- OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT documented in .env.example: PASS (T17.2 — PR #88)
- CLAUDE.md stale references removed: PASS (T17.3 — PR #87)
- Phase 16 backlog corrected (migration 002 -> 003): PASS (T17.3 — PR #87)
- 5 stale remote branches cleaned: PASS (T17.3 — PR #87)
- ADR format consistency (4 ADRs fixed): PASS (T17.3 — PR #87)
- README current with Phase 16 complete, Phase 17 in progress: PASS (T17.3 — PR #87)
- CLAUDE.md under 500 lines: PASS (498 lines) (T17.4 — PR #89)
- RETRO_LOG under 800 lines: PASS (435 lines) (T17.4 — PR #89)
- Conditional reviewer spawning: PASS — tested on T17.4 (docs-only -> QA+DevOps only)
- Consolidated review commits: PASS — first use on T17.4
- Materiality threshold + small-fix batching rules: PASS (Rules 16+17)
- All quality gates passing: PASS
- Phase 17 end-of-phase retrospective completed: this entry

**Open advisory count**: 1 (ADV-015 — pgbouncer phantom tag BLOCKER)

**What went well**:
1. T17.2 and T17.3 ran in parallel on separate feature branches with non-overlapping files.
   T17.3 merged while T17.2 was still in review. This is the first time the PM successfully
   parallelized two tasks within a phase.
2. T17.4 was the first task to use the new conditional reviewer spawning and consolidated
   review commit format. Both worked correctly: UI/UX and Architecture reviewers were
   correctly skipped (docs-only task), and the single review: commit replaced 4 separate
   commits with no loss of information.
3. The RETRO_LOG archival was dramatic — 2687 to 435 lines. Future developer agents will
   consume ~85% fewer tokens on RETRO_LOG scans.
4. Every review FINDING was fixed before merge (T17.1 arch finding, T17.2 UI/UX finding,
   T17.4 QA finding). The feedback_review_findings_must_be_fixed memory held.

**What could improve**:
1. The "change the spec, forget the consumers" pattern recurred in T17.4 — CLAUDE.md commit
   format changed but .claude/agents/ files weren't updated. This is the same class of
   failure as T17.3 (AUTONOMOUS_DEVELOPMENT_PROMPT retirement left stale references). Both
   the PM brief and the developer agent should grep consumer files when changing process docs.
2. The T17.2 QA review arrived after the PR was already merged (10+ minute review on a
   frontend change). Its 3 findings (vacuous aria-invalid assertions, weak toBeGreaterThanOrEqual
   bound, implicit EMPTY_FORM dependency) are valid but cosmetic — batched for Phase 18 per
   Rule 16.
3. ADV-015 (pgbouncer phantom tag) remains open. It requires an ADR for technology substitution
   (Rule 6) and is appropriately tracked as a BLOCKER for the next pgbouncer-related task.

### [2026-03-16] P17-T17.4 — Process Governance Slimming

**Changes**:
- `CLAUDE.md`: Consolidated from 603 to 498 lines. Merged Rules 1+5 (Rule 5 is strict superset).
  Deleted Rule 14 (ChromaDB seeding — unvalidated overhead). Added conditional reviewer
  spawning (UI/UX only for frontend, Arch only for src/). Consolidated review commits
  (one review: commit per task instead of 4). Added Rule 15 (sunset clause), Rule 16
  (materiality threshold), Rule 17 (small-fix batching). All retrospective-sourced rules
  tagged [sunset: Phase 22].
- `docs/RETRO_LOG.md`: Archived phases 0-14 to `docs/retro_archive/`. Reduced from 2687 to 404 lines.
- `.claude/agents/pr-reviewer.md`, `.claude/agents/pr-describer.md`: Updated for consolidated
  review commit format (review: instead of review(qa/devops/arch/ui-ux):).
- `docs/backlog/phase-17.md`: T17.4 spec added. `docs/backlog/phase-18.md`: New backlog.

**Quality Gates**: Docs/process task. pre-commit: PASS. CLAUDE.md: 498 lines (<500). RETRO_LOG: 404 lines (<800).

**Review**: QA FINDING (1 blocker fixed), DevOps PASS

**QA**: pr-reviewer.md and pr-describer.md still used old `review(qa):` grep patterns — fixed.
Rule numbering gap (14 deleted) — cosmetic, batched per Rule 16. Advisory table intact.

**DevOps**: All scans clean. No CI impact from Rule 14 deletion. seed_chroma_retro.py orphaned
but harmless — T18.2 will resolve.

**Retrospective Note**:
"Change the spec, forget the consumers" pattern recurred — identical to T17.3's
AUTONOMOUS_DEVELOPMENT_PROMPT fix. Future governance changes must grep `.claude/agents/*.md`.
Conditional reviewer spawning saved ~26K tokens on this docs-only task (2 guaranteed SKIPs avoided).

### [2026-03-16] P17-T17.2 — Dashboard WCAG Form Accessibility Parity

**Changes**:
- `frontend/src/routes/Dashboard.tsx`: Added `aria-required="true"` to all 4 form inputs
  (`table_name`, `parquet_path`, `total_epochs`, `checkpoint_every_n`). Added
  `aria-invalid="true"` to `total_epochs` and `checkpoint_every_n` when client-side
  validation fails. Visible asterisks wrapped with `aria-hidden="true"`. Form validation
  error div (`role="alert"`) changed from conditional mount/unmount to always-present
  container with conditional text content (UI/UX review fix).
- `frontend/src/__tests__/Dashboard.test.tsx`: 5 new tests for aria attribute presence.
  4 existing RFC 7807 tests updated to handle multiple `role="alert"` elements.
- `.env.example`: Added `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` documentation section with
  explanatory comments about optional observability configuration. Fixed `pip install` ->
  `poetry add` in the Requires comment (DevOps review fix).
- `tests/unit/test_docker_image_pinning.py`: Added `type: ignore` justification comment
  (T17.1 arch review carry-forward).

**Quality Gates**:
- ruff check: PASS, ruff format: PASS, mypy: PASS, bandit: PASS
- Frontend lint: PASS, type-check: PASS, test coverage: 98.84% (131/131) — PASS
- pre-commit (all hooks): PASS

**QA** (PASS):
dead-code PASS — no dead code introduced. reachable-handlers PASS — all test branches
reachable. exception-specificity PASS. silent-failures PASS. coverage-gate PASS — 98.84%
frontend coverage. edge-cases PASS — both valid and invalid states tested for aria
attributes. meaningful-asserts PASS — all assertions verify specific aria attribute values.
backlog-compliance PASS — all 5 ACs addressed.

**DevOps** (PASS with advisory):
hardcoded-credentials PASS. no-pii-in-code PASS. supply-chain PASS. dependency-management
ADVISORY — `.env.example` line 216 said `pip install` instead of `poetry add` for
opentelemetry-exporter-otlp. Fixed in review fix commit.

**UI/UX** (FINDING — 1 blocker fixed):
aria-required PASS — all 4 inputs have `aria-required="true"`. aria-invalid PASS —
`total_epochs` and `checkpoint_every_n` correctly set `aria-invalid="true"` on validation
failure. aria-hidden PASS — visible asterisks wrapped with `aria-hidden="true"`.
FINDING: `role="alert"` div for form validation errors used conditional mount/unmount.
NVDA+Firefox can silently swallow repeat error announcements when the container is
destroyed and recreated with identical content. Fix: changed to always-present container
with conditional text content. Fixed in review fix commit.

**Retrospective Note**:
The Unseal.tsx -> Dashboard.tsx WCAG parity task revealed a subtle screen reader
announcement bug: conditional rendering of role="alert" containers works for one-shot
errors but fails for repeated identical errors in NVDA+Firefox. The always-present
container pattern (render container, conditionally fill content) is more robust. This
should be the standard pattern going forward for all role="alert" containers in the
project.

### [2026-03-16] P17-T17.3 — CLAUDE.md Stale References, Backlog Spec Fix & Branch Cleanup

**Changes**:
- `CLAUDE.md`: 4 stale `AUTONOMOUS_DEVELOPMENT_PROMPT.md` references replaced with current equivalents
- `docs/backlog/phase-16.md`: "Migration 002" -> "Migration 003" (5 occurrences corrected)
- 4 ADR files: format inconsistency fixed
- `README.md`: Phase 16 -> Complete, Phase 17 -> In Progress
- `docs/BACKLOG.md`: Phase 17 indexed
- 5 stale remote branches deleted (P15-T15.2, P16-T16.1, P16-T16.2, P16-T16.3, fix/P16-T16.3)

**Quality Gates**: Docs-only task. pre-commit: PASS. No Python code changes.

**QA** (PASS): Coverage 96.24% unchanged.
**DevOps** (PASS): gitleaks clean. docs-gate CI satisfied by docs: commit prefix.
**UI/UX** (SKIP): No UI surface area.

**Retrospective Note**:
The AUTONOMOUS_DEVELOPMENT_PROMPT.md retirement (Phase 3.5) left 4 stale references that
survived until Phase 17. Future doc-retirement operations should include a grep-and-replace
sweep as part of the retirement commit itself to avoid multi-phase cleanup.

---

### [2026-03-16] P17-T17.1 — Docker Base Image SHA-256 Pinning (ADV-014)

**Changes**:
- `Dockerfile`: All three FROM lines pinned to SHA-256 digests via Docker Registry v2 API.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Six of seven external service images pinned. pgbouncer tag
  confirmed non-existent; WARNING(P17-T17.1) comment added. Tracked as ADV-015 (BLOCKER).
- `tests/unit/test_docker_image_pinning.py`: 17 new file-inspection tests.

**Quality Gates**: ruff: PASS, mypy: PASS, bandit: PASS, pytest: 842 passed 96.24% — PASS

**QA** (PASS): All items PASS. coverage-gate PASS — 96.24%.
**Architecture** (PASS): adr-compliance ADVISORY — pgbouncer replacement requires ADR per Rule 6; tracked ADV-015 BLOCKER.
**DevOps** (FINDING): `pgbouncer/pgbouncer:1.23.1` does not exist in Docker Hub. Tracked as ADV-015 (BLOCKER).
**UI/UX** (SKIP): No UI surface area.

**Retrospective Note**:
Before declaring an image reference pinnable, verify the tag exists in the registry.
pgbouncer/pgbouncer:1.23.1 is a phantom tag that was silently referenced for 17+ phases.
Image reference validation should be a separate pre-production checklist item.

---

### [2026-03-16] Phase 16 End-of-Phase Retrospective

**Phase Goal**: Close Alembic migration drift, fix undeclared frontend deps, improve nosec
accuracy, add operator docs, add WCAG skip navigation.

**Exit Criteria**: All PASS. Open advisory count: 0.

**What went well**: Review agents caught real issues in all 3 tasks. GitHub auto-delete finally
enabled after 3 retro entries. ADR-0030 closed 7-phase Float->NUMERIC debt.

**What could improve**: PR #84 auto-merged before UI/UX review completed. nosec+docstring
atomicity: both must be updated together. Sequence number specs should use relative references.

---

### [2026-03-16] P16-T16.1, T16.2, T16.3 — Phase 16 Tasks

See Phase 16 End-of-Phase Retrospective above for details.

---

### [2026-03-16] Phase 15 End-of-Phase Retrospective

**Phase Goal**: Fix frontend test coverage gate, enforce in CI, clean stale branches, update README.

**Exit Criteria**: All PASS. Open advisory count: 0.

**What went well**: Root cause precise. Fix minimal. CI gate verified working.

**What could improve**: Coverage gate broken since Phase 14. Stale branches — enable auto-delete.
