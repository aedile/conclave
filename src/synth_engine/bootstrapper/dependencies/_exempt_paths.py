"""Shared exempt-path constants for middleware gates.

Centralizes the path exemption sets that were previously duplicated across
``vault.py``, ``licensing.py``, and ``auth.py`` (ADV-T39.1-01).

Layered exemption model (P50 review fix)
-----------------------------------------
Different middleware layers enforce access control at different levels.
Each layer imports the appropriate constant for its security posture:

:data:`COMMON_INFRA_EXEMPT_PATHS` — **auth baseline** (9 paths)
    Pre-auth bootstrapping and infrastructure paths that must be reachable
    before any credential is issued or the vault is unsealed.  This is the
    most restrictive set — anything in it bypasses all three gates.
    ``AuthenticationGateMiddleware`` (``auth.py``) composes from this set.
    Security routes are **NOT** included here: they require JWT auth.

:data:`SEAL_EXEMPT_PATHS` — **vault/license gate set** (10 paths)
    Extends ``COMMON_INFRA_EXEMPT_PATHS`` with ``/security/shred`` so that
    the emergency cryptographic shred protocol remains reachable even when
    the vault is sealed (or unlicensed).  ``SealGateMiddleware`` (``vault.py``)
    and ``LicenseGateMiddleware`` (``licensing.py``) use this set.

    ``/security/keys/rotate`` is deliberately **excluded**: key rotation
    requires an unsealed vault to access the KEK.  When sealed, the request
    reaches the route handler (via ``SEAL_EXEMPT_PATHS`` not containing it,
    meaning the seal gate blocks it with 423), which is the correct behaviour.

#: Auth baseline: paths accessible to all middleware gates regardless of system state.
#:
#: These 9 paths cover pre-auth bootstrapping and infrastructure concerns that must
#: remain reachable before the vault is unsealed, a license is activated, or an
#: operator has authenticated:
#:
#: - ``/unseal`` — vault unsealing (pre-boot)
#: - ``/health`` — liveness probe (infra)
#: - ``/ready`` — readiness probe (infra; Kubernetes readiness gate)
#: - ``/metrics`` — Prometheus scrape (infra)
#: - ``/docs``, ``/redoc``, ``/openapi.json`` — API documentation
#: - ``/license/challenge``, ``/license/activate`` — offline license activation
#:
#: Security routes (``/security/shred``, ``/security/keys/rotate``) are **not**
#: included here — they require JWT authentication (ADV-P47-04).
#: Use :data:`SEAL_EXEMPT_PATHS` for the vault and license gate exemption set.
